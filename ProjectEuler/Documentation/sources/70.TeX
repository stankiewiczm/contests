The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three interesting properties.
\begin{enumerate}
   \item The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).
   \item Each polygonal type: triangle ($P_{3,127}=8128$), square ($P_{4,91}=8281$), and pentagonal ($P_{5,44}=2882$), is represented by a different number in the set.
   \item This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.
\end{enumerate}
Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set.

\sol{61}
Well step one is to generate all these numbers -- there are between 68 and 40 of each.  Thankfully they generally don't match up front-to-end, so if we choose an ordering, the 6-times nested loop evaluates very quickly.  Then we must work through each of the 120 possible orderings -- the very dirty way (5-deep nested loop from 1 to 5) will work fine, as it only performs 3000 excess entries.  In the end we go: $(8256\to5625\to2512\to1281\to8128\to2882)$, which is
Triangle$\to$Square$\to$Heptagon$\to$Octagon$\to$Hexagon$\to$Pentagon$\to$Triangle.

The cube, 41063625 ($345^3$), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 ($384^3$) and 66430125 ($405^3$). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.

Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.

The program can be run for each number of digits.  Starting at 8-digit cubes, sort all the digits in each cube of length $n$, add to a big list, sort, and check for 5 consecutive entries.  Once the required repeat is found, run through the cubes again and find the smallest one that gets sorted into the required form.

Observe that if $a \geq 10$, then $a^n$ will have at least $n+1$ digits. So need only consider bases of at most 9.
Then, if $a^n$ has less than $n$ digits, all higher powers will also have too few digits.  A simple double loop does the rest.

All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form:
$\sqrt{n} = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1+\frac{1}{a_2+\cdot}}$
For example, let us consider $\sqrt{23}$:
$$\sqrt{23} = 4 + \sqrt{23} - 4 = 4 + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{23}-4}} = 4 + \frac{1}{1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}7}$$
If we continue we would get the following expansion:
$\sqrt{23} = 4 + \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{3+\frac{1}{4+\cdots}}}.$
The process can be summarised as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{23}-3} = 1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}7 &\qquad &\frac{7}{\sqrt{23}-3} = 3+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}2 \\
\frac{2}{\sqrt{23}-3} = 1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-4}7 &\qquad &\frac{7}{\sqrt{23}-4} = 8 + \sqrt{23}-4,
\end{eqnarray*}
after which it can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the notation $\sqrt{23} = [4;(1,3,1,8)]$, to indicate that the block $(1,3,1,8)$ repeats indefinitely.

The first ten continued fraction representations of irrational square roots are:

\sol{64}
It is clear that the first number, $\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor$ is not generally part of the recurring section.  So start off
with $\sqrt{n} - \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor$.  This can be written as $k + \frac{\sqrt{n}-N}D$.  So in the above example, we have $[4,1,4]$.  Now a little algebra will show that the next values are $k' \equiv \lfloor D/(\sqrt{n}-N)\rfloor$, $D' \equiv (n - N^2)/D$ and $N' \equiv k'D'-N$.  So iterating it we can repeat until the triplet $[k,N,D]$ has been before, which means that the sequence has started recurring.  Then it is just a question of checking the length of the list.

The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
$\sqrt 2 = 1 + 	\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\cdots}}}$
The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt2 = [1;(2)]$, (2) indicates that 2 repeats ad infinitum. In a similar way, $\sqrt{23} = [4;(1,3,1,8)]$.

It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$.
$$ 1+\frac{1}{2} = \frac 32 \qquad 1+\frac{1}{2+\frac 12} = \frac 75 \qquad \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}2}} = \frac{17}{12} \qquad \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac 12}}} = \frac{41}{29} $$
Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\sqrt{2}$ are:
$$1,\; 3/2,\; 7/5,\; 17/12,\; 41/29,\; 99/70,\; 239/169,\; 577/408,\; 1393/985,\; 3363/2378$$
What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,
$$e = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , \dots , 1,2k,1, \dots].$$
The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for $e$ are:
$$2, \;3, \;8/3, \;11/4, \;19/7, \;87/32, \;106/39, \;193/71, \;1264/465, \;1457/536, ...$$
The sum of digits in the numerator of the $10^{\text{th}}$ convergent is $1+4+5+7=17$.

Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the $100^{\text{th}}$ convergent of the continued fraction for $e$.

\sol{65}
This is a question of starting at the end (or bottom) of the continuing fraction.  The form of the continued fraction is given, so we start off with $N_1 = L[100]$, and $D_1 = 1$.  Then we work backwards, as follows:
$$N_{i+1} = L[100-i-1]\cdot N_i + D_i \qquad \hbox{and } \qquad D_{i+1} = N_i.$$
With the Python long integers, there is no worry about integer overlows.  It turns out that the 100$^\text{th}$ convergent fraction for $e$ is
$$\frac{N_{100}}{D_{100}} = \frac{6963524437876961749120273824619538346438023188214475670667}{2561737478789858711161539537921323010415623148113041714756}.$$

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
$$ x^2 – Dy^2 = 1$$
For example, when $D=13$, the minimal solution in $x$ is $649^2 – 13\times180^2 = 1.$
It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when $D$ is square.
By finding minimal solutions in $x$ for $D = \{2, 3, 5, 6, 7\}$, we obtain the following:
\begin{eqnarray*}
3^2 - 2\times2^2 &= &1 \\
2^2 - 3\times1^2 &= &1 \\
9^2 - 5\times4^2 &= &1 \\
5^2 - 6\times2^2 &= &1 \\
8^2 - 7\times3^2 &= &1
\end{eqnarray*}
Hence, by considering minimal solutions in $x$ for $D \leq 7$, the largest $x$ is obtained when $D=5$.

Find the value of $D \leq 1000$ in minimal solutions of $x$ for which the largest value of $x$ is obtained.

Well this question is a bit of beast, but with a quick solution, if you know how.  The best hint is that it comes directly after questions 64 and 65.  Those questions involved finding the continued fraction expressions of irrational square roots, and the evaluation of a finite sequence of them.  It was noted that these are also the best rational approximations to the roots.

Now if $x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$, then $\tfrac xy \approx \sqrt{D}$.  So the idea is to take `good approximations' to $\sqrt{D}$ and see if they satisfy this equation (also known as Pell's).  Adapting the code from the previous two questions is then easy.  For each $D$, find the continued fraction expansion, at each step evaluate the expansion as $x/y$ and see if $x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$.  The minimality of the solution and the termination of the algorithm are taken a bit on faith.

$(1+\cdots+10)+(1+\cdots+5) = 70$, so 14 per side.  The six must get a $5+3$, the 10 must get $3+1$, the 9 then gets $1+4$,

It is well known that if $n = \prod_{i} p_i^{\alpha_i}$, then $\varphi(n) = \prod_i (p_i-1) \prod_i p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}-1}.$
So the ratio $n/\varphi(n) = \prod_i \left( 1-\tfrac 1{p_i}\right),$ so to maximize it, we wish to use as many small distinct primes as possible (repeating primes does not change the ratio).  So we take the largest product below the given limit:
$2\times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17.$

The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so $\varphi(1)=1$.

Interestingly, $\varphi(87109)=79180$, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.

Find the value of $n$, $1 < n < 10^7$, for which $\varphi(n)$ is a permutation of $n$ and the ratio $n/\varphi(n)$ produces a minimum.

As in the last question, $n/\varphi(n) = \prod_i \left( 1-\tfrac 1{p_i}\right)$.  Clearly, $n$ cannot be a prime, as $p$ and $p-1=\varphi(p)$ are not permutations of each other.  So we try to find the next best thing -- a product of two largish primes. So start a loop over the first prime $p_1$ from around 1000 to 1000$\sqrt{10}$, and the second prime $p_2 > p_1$, such that that the product is below $10^7$.  Check $n = p_1p_2$ and $\varphi(n) = p_1p_2 - p_1-p_2+1$ if they contain the same digits,
and check if the ratio is smaller than the previous best.  Repeat till done.  The winner is 2339$\times$3557.
